I'm a software engineer currently at Auto Trader, working on all sorts of infrastructure and platform engineering bits and bobs. I'm a generalist rather than a specialist, so when infra gets too difficult I'll probably retire to the woods and write Wordpress themes for a living.

I also enjoy running around the pavements near my flat (for fun).
